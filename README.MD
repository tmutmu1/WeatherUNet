# Using Radar Data to Predict the Weather

will add more to this readme in the future


Note:
pytorch_resnet18_unet_old is an older version of our current file

make sure to add in steps on how to run the correct file, mention how instructions to download the data are in Weather tiles
(might have to update those steps as well with new code)

eg. change the ubuntuos/etc... to your own repository where the data is located and etc...
